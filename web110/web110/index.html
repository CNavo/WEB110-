       <h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2>
       
       <p>Youngest of a family of 3, I was born in Allentown PA where I spent the majority of my childhood.  Just before entering Middle School the family transferred out to the Midwest where I graduated High School in Indiana, and later college for the first time in Nebraska.  My parents had then since moved to Georgia, my eldest sister and her family near San Diego, and my middle sister remained in Indiana to raise her daughter. Sadly my middle sibling passed away nearly 10 years ago, her daughter, my niece is now raising a daughter of her own. This year tragedy struck again, when my dad passed away initialized by a stroke. The rest of the family remains physically healthy and well.</p>
           
      <p>When I went to college the first time, Archaeology and Ancient Antiquity History were my studies of interest.  With my certificate of completion, I worked freelance with other students across the world specializing in Marine Archaeology.  After my last contract ran out I returned to Nebraska where shorty thereafter I moved to south Florida for a change of scenery. I lived in Florida for 5 years where I met my partner and after 3 years, married and finally moved to Seattle in late summer of 2017 with our dog, Jasper.</p>

       <h3>Interests</h3>

       <p>One of the Pacific Northwest's greatest draws was the outdoors, I enjoy hiking, the lakes, forests, and mountainscapes of Washington, and do my best to stay fit and active as best I can.</p> 
       <p>I (and thankfully my spouse too) are geeks at heart and enjoy my passive hobbies including, reading, video gaming, playing Dungeons and Dragons with a group of friends, and we belong to a local group here called AFOLs. Which are Adult Fans of Lego where we have monthly discussions of events such as Seattle's Brickcon, a convention in October, where adult lego builders all across the globe come and display their creative craft.  When I have spare time, I continue to work on my first fantasy-fiction novel with the hopes of one day publishing my work.</p>


       <p>I continue to set goals and aspirations for myself.  One of those as soon as I settled into Seattle (besides getting a job to pay the bills) was to go back to school.  I could not think of a better career path than Computer Science.  As I just started taking classes I have yet to decide what specialized part of this major I will want to do but only time will tell. </p>
